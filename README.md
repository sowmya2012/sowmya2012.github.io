## Discover your Hogwarts house

Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They chose to split the students into four â€˜housesâ€™, each bearing their surnames. The Sorting Hat decides which children should go into which house, and so there has been a yearly Sorting Ceremony that places each new pupil into their own new home.

##### Gryffindor 

> Where dwell The Brave at Heart.

##### Hufflepuff 

> Where they are Just and Loyal.

##### Ravenclaw 

> Where those of wit and Learning.

##### Slytherin 

> Where they are Ambitious and Cunning.
